************~GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROJECT~************

Going into the mancala project, I was really worried I wouldn't be able to complete it because it involves implementing all the techniques we have learned throughout the semester into this one project. Originally I was going to choose to do the Friends with Files project as it seemed more fundamental and easier to grasp, but later decided I might as well work on a term project that I'd be proud of. 

I had several difficulties while working through Mancala. Most of the functions were pretty basic and easy to create, one that took me a while to figure out though, was figuring out the coordinates of the board and visualizing the dimensions by drawing out the entire board before being able to write get_pebble_coors(). Another difficulty I had was just generally trying to debug the code especially when the game would run, but in some instances maybe a player would pick up all the pebbles from a store which it shouldn't, or it would skip a house when dropping pebbles. Another difficulty was definitely creating the test cases because in past assignments it wasn't something I had to worry about and therefore took sometime getting used to. Probably the most frustrating part was trying to figure out how the AI was supposed to work because I didn't fully understand what the run_with_ai() code was doing and so running the game when ai_opt == True never worked out properly.

I approached the assignment just by following all the guidelines both in the mancala.py file as well as the instructions/descriptions online, and writing all the functions in the order given in mancala.py. I also wrote out a lot of things in a notebook and drew out the board to figure out how the game worked. Through the debugging process I manually wrote out the steps of functions in a notebook as well to pinpoint the location of bugs. I definitely failed a lot of times before getting to a final product that worked decently. I had stupid mistakes like indents that were wrong or an extra bracket, which took time to find, and getting the pebbles to stay in the wells was frustrating at times as well.
